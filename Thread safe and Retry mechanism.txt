ThreadLocal Class to avoid sync issues: Make it thread safe:
Create object of Threadlocal class and push the extent test object into by using set command.
ThreadLocal extentTest = new ThreadLocal();
extentTest.set(test);      // test is the extent test object
extentTest.get();          // Replace the extent test object with extentTest.get() in listeners

This removes any issues with tests being run concurrently.

================================================================
IRetry mechanism to rerun the failed flaky tests:
Create a Retry class which implements IRetryAnalyzer class.

public class Retry implements IRetryAnalyzer {
int count = 0;
int maxTry = 1;
public boolean retry(ITestResult result){
if(count<maxTry){
count++
return true
}}}
In order to give this info to tests that can fail, add the following details @test annotation for the specific tests that can fail.
@Test(retryAnalyzer = Retry.class)     // Retry is the classname where logic is added.
